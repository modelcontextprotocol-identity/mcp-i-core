## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode — no any types
- No console.log — use the logger from src/logging/index.ts
- .js extension on all imports (ESM)
- No thrown errors in resolvers — return null on failure, log at debug level
- Run npm run lint before pushing

---

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork and create a branch from main
2. Make changes with DCO-signed commits (git commit -s)
3. Ensure all tests pass: npm test
4. Note relevant SPEC.md sections if your change affects the protocol
5. Update CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased]
6. Open a PR against main and fill out the PR template

---

## Spec Changes

Protocol changes should be discussed in DIF TAAWG before implementation. Open an issue first.
